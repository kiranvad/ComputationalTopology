# Computational Topology 
This repository contains Ipython note books for computational topology concepts. Large part of the repository comrpises of example notebooks from computational topology concepts ranging from computing basic persistence diagrams to computing circular coordinates.

A description of the avaialble notebooks can be found below:

1. [Computing a persitence diagram using scikit-tda]()
2. [Computing circular coordinates using scikit-tda and dionysus]()
